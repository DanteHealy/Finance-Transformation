# "Finance Transformation" by Dante Healy
## Background: 
My first project from The Code Institute Full Stack Developer course is to create a fully functioning webpage using HTML, CSS plus applicable frameworks e.g. Bootstrap. 
The subect involves "Finance Transformation" which I'm passionate about and is my current target career. 
I've included my bio and contact in case this webpage interests anyone who might be looking for a Finance change agent. 
As this is my first project I've elected to keep things as simple as possible whilst trying to apply as much design cues as appropriate in order to attract users to my webpage. 


## User Experience (UX):
The purpose of this website is to build my personal brand by leveraging my knowledge of Finance transformation, through: 
 - Highlighting the challenges some Finance organisations have with modernising and 
 - Communicating my value by educating Finance professionals on how to effectively link strategy to execution through the application of the target operating model and project management frameworks. 
In essence I am planning to use this website as a content marketing campaign with my skills as the product which I will post on LinkedIn to demonstrate my knowledge of Finance and strategic change programmes and projects with contact details should anyone want to reach out to me.

- As a Finance Leader, I can learn about what makes a Finance Transformation successful so that I can apply best practice in my plans to design and deliver effective change. I may want to engage Dante for a transformation project in the future. 
- As a Finance Professional, I can learn about “Finance Transformation” so that I can decide if it’s a suitable career path for me. If it resonates I might also follow Dante for more thought leadership or reach out for career advice.
- As a recruiter or employer of Finance professionals I can evaluate Dante's expertise with respect to delivering Finance Transformation and contact him for further opportunities.

## Features:
Building a website based on x3 sections as per initial wireframes (Balsamiq) with working navigation and a responsive layout using a mobile-first approach. 

### Overall for all pages 
Navbar header - has a navigation menu that collapses when viewed on smaller screens placed in the top right corner. The Logo image is hyperlinked so that the user can go straight back to the home page without opening the hamburger to toggle and zooms when on hover so they are aware it does something. 
The footer has social media icons with links to my social media accounts in order to connect and / or follow me. 

### Home Page: 
Problem statement on the challenge of Finance Transformation. 
Heading and subheading was followed by an image that zooms on hover. 
Then more content with some hyperlinks plus further text aligned next to images for illustration. 

### Operating Model 
Presented as the Target Operating Model as a solution for translating the high level plans into a clear map for solving the challenge posed on the Home page. 
More text explaining how Operating models work with an outline of the groups (People, Process and Technology) on Bootstrap cards with image, text and icons for illustration. 
More text on the challenge of Transformation then a picture of a path that also zooms on hover. 
Then text content about successful execution. The key components are illustrated with icons and more text. 

### Contact
My photo with a short bio. I have two buttons with flashing arrows one on top ("Mailto:" popup) and one below (link to my CV) a carousel running past some of my LinkedIn endorsements providing social proof of my credibility. 
Further down the page I list some useful links including my previous blogs plus the details of Professional organisations I'm associated with.

5. Git: Version control system for tracking changes to your coding projects. https://git-scm.com/
6. Github: A software development repository where people can host and collaborate on coding projects. https://github.com/
7. Chrome DevTools: For editing pages and diagnosing issues via Google Chrome browse. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools
8. Balsamiq: Wireframe tool for my low fidelity initial designs. https://balsamiq.com/
9. Fontawesome for their lovely icons. https://fontawesome.com/
10. Google fonts for their fonts. https://fonts.google.com/
9. Free Logo Maker: https://www.freelogoservices.com/
10. Royalty free images:

11. Birme: A web portal for sizing multiple images to the exact same scale at the same time. https://www.birme.net/?target_width=2500
12. W3C Markup Validation for error checking my code. https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri
13. Used Am I Responsive? for validating the design of my webpages on various screen sizes at the same time. http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#
14. Google and Youtube for ad hoc problems. 


## Testing:

### Reviews of webpage
##### 1. Tested the screens myself on multiple devices (Laptop, iPad and iPhone 7)
##### 2. Sent the webpage to my selected friends (work colleagues and LinkedIn contacts) and family (wife and brother) to test on their devices and provide feedback 
##### 3. Posted my link via workflow on the Peer-Review SLACK group with the Code Institute for feedback 
##### 4. Had my content and design reviewed by certain select people amongst my LinkedIn contacts for any changes neede. 
##### 5. Tested all the links and features as I was coding to ensure that they worked as I was coding. 

### Coding Error checks
##### 6. Used the validator to check HTML and CSS code to verify it was clean. Corrected it until all the tabs returned as clean.

##### 7. Double-check the visual effect on multiple screens using the 'Am I Responsive?' online tool. 
See page header. 


#### Issues identified in testing: 
1. Wording edits required in my copy. Initial content was described as 'too wordy' or needed minor spelling corrections. 
2. Initial web design was functional, but lacked creativity: I added some highlight and underline (see red) in the heading and searched for better pictures (using Adobe for a free 1 month trial) and added some zoom animations to a couple of pictures. 
3. Also, initial use of fonts was lacking so I looked at Google fonts for professional combinations and elected for Roboto sans serif, with Playfair display (for my quote sections)
4. Remove the flashing red arrows in my contact buttons as they were too much!: I preferred to keep them, but made them much smaller and used a consistent shade of red (using the Bootstrap danger color scheme which is less 'loud')
5. Content again: Aim to be less verbose and more purposeful in my writing. Avoid long words for shorter more 'punchier' comments. 
    Reviewed the content and edited down. Also, added cards with pictures to make the People, Process, Technology section more user friendly. 
6. I had the logo wtih a comment section next to it and the logo was going to my LinkedIn page, but was advised this was duplication and therefore I instead repointed the link to the homepage: Done. 
    Note: Also removed target="_blank" and had to resize the logo image in CSS as it resized when I replaced the navbar title text.
7. Reduced the size of the social media icons in the footer as they didn't line up nicely when using a mobile view: Done. 

Additional testing comments: 
Any obvious spacing, design or layout issues were tracked and either fixed immediately, or checked with the SLACK group or de-scoped after alternative solution was found and successfully deployed. 
The sizing of the endorsements on the carousel are not ideal, but the length of their recommendations varied so I had to accomodate this so I couldn't align this perfectly. 
The birme tool was helful in that initial image loads caused the height of the carousel to change in transition which for me was not pleasant to look at: 
    See example in the middle of this webpage here: https://gordontredgold.com/ (Note: Gordon is an excellent thought leader in the Transformation space, I'm just commenting on this particular aspect of the webpage)


## Deployment:
My site is being hosted on Github: https://dantehealy.github.io/first-milestone-project/

1. Established my own Github account by registering on https://github.com/ 
    If you are reading this file you are already accessing my public profile which is https://github.com/DanteHealy 
2. Install https://www.gitpod.io/ which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides me an integrated ready to code environment which is very convenient. 
    Note: I recommend to use the Google Chrome browser to do all your coding based on my experience with Microsoft Edge. 
3. To set up the 'first-milestone-project' repository I used the Code Institute template https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template and click on the "Use this template" button.
4. I set up my repository name and description and click on the "Create repository from template" button. 
5. With the necessary templates I can hit the "Gitpod" button on the top right hand corner to start coding. 
6. After initial commits I accessed the repository and checked settings. 
7. In the GitHub pages section I go to source and select Master branch. 
8. This created a URL and advised me that my site is now published. 
9. Further commits were reflected on to my site when pushed from Gitpod ('git commit origin master' in the command line interface). 

For future deployments I will aim to look at hosting externally, but due to the current limitations of my knowledge I will keep this first project milestone project hosted on GitHub.
